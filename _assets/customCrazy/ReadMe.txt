Here you can customize Crazy animations Assets.

In 3 folders, default will be use if no by system custom is present, so you can create only defaults to have one customised animation.

Be careful, if default files are't in place, comix crazy will display by default.

You can use one of 3 files in each folder i have added and rename it to default.png to use comix, kowa or blank default(last will not display anything when system is not customized).

Or you can create by system, in 3 folder you can name characters, bars, and bubbles by system theme name (megadrive, snes, mastersystem etc..)

In each folder you will find an XCF file to use with Gimp.
