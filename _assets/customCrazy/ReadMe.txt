Here you can customize Crazy animations Assets.

In 3 folders, default will be use if no by system custom is present, so you can create only defaults to have one customised animation.

Or you can create by system, in 3 folder you can name characters, bars, and bubbles by system theme name (megadrive, snes, mastersystem etc..)

In each folder you will find an XCF file to use with Gimp.
