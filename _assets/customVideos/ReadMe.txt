Here you can create folders by theme name (megadrive, snes, neogeo etc..) and put video files at low resolution (for example 240p to 360p).

Videos must be named "01.mp4", "02.mp4", "03.mp4", "04.mp4", "05.mp4", "06.mp4", "07.mp4".

They will played in the 7 tiles of systemview layer in order from upper left (01.mp4) to bottom right (07.mp4).

Audio is desactived but if you want a specific parameter for one video on one system you can specify in "(system).xml" file in "_assets/variables/" folder
